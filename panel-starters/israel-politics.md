Israeli Politics Debate:

Motion written by: Daniel Rosehill

The State of Israel suffers from an ongoing cost of living problem and has one of the highest rates of income inequality in the world. Israel's transition from socialist backwater to regional superpower was brought about, in large part, by transitioning from a socialist economy to a high tech one.

It is human nature, perhaps, to think that more of a good thing will lead to a better thing. However, that is not always the case.

We cannot predicate the viability of an entire economy upon one industry (technology). Nor can we sculpt our education system to focus solely upon producing a workforce for that economy by focusing on STEM subjects to the exclusion of all other domains.

Another social problem facing Israeli society is that of a political level that concerns itself almost entirely with matters of national security. Fundamentals like the cost of living and the affordability of housing are permanently eclipsed by wars and matters of state.

There is a feeling in Israel that the country needs a better way forward. An economy that is less binary - where those in "high tech" enjoy high wages and the rest of the econonmy, and country, is left to languish, earning wages that don't match the cost of living.

I feel that the way our political system is architected is part of the problem: the concept of elected representatives with a geographical mandate is foreign to Israel.As a result, the political system acts with a lack of accountability.
